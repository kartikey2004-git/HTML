 <!--The 5500 in the URL http://127.0.0.1:5500/ refers to the port number on which the web server is running. When you run a web server locally, the port number specifies which communication endpoint the server is using to listen for requests.

 127.0.0.1 is the loopback IP address that refers to the local computer (localhost), meaning the server is only accessible from the same machine.
 5500 is the port number, which can be any valid port, and in this case, it's likely that you're using a development server (like Live Server in VS Code or another tool) that defaults to port 5500.
 So, 5500 identifies the specific communication channel used by the server on your local machine.-->
